If you are playing on GTNH-2.8.4, you can simply replace `Schematica-1.12.6-GTNH.jar` with it.

Otherwise, you would need to also install **[LunatriusCore](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/LunatriusCore/releases)**(>= 1.2.1-GTNH).

I'm currently working on other projects, so development is on hold for now.

If you’d like to contribute to this enhanced mod, feel free to go ahead.

### Changes from GTNH-ver:
- Added most functions from [Litematica](https://github.com/maruohon/litematica/), made it more user-friendly.

For example:
- Loading multiple schematic instances.
- Pasting schematics (including NBT tags, block states, entities, etc.) directly into the world when having permissions.
- Storing blocks and entities with NBT tags.
- Different edit modes, making it a lite version of World Edit (jk).
- Supports `.litematic` (I have zero idea on why I decided to implement this, but it does work really well).
- Modern GUI from [Litematica](https://github.com/maruohon/litematica/) (Still working on this).

### Changes from Original:
- Store Coordinates & rotation of schematics per world/server. No more re-entering coordinates for large builds!
- Fix heavy lag when having lotr armor stands/weapon racks in loaded schematic
- Updated Chinese translation
